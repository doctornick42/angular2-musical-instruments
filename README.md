# Angular 2 Musical Instruments

This project is based on [angular.io quickstart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart),
a great source to start learning Angular 2 and to build some test applications with.

## Short description

This repository contains my first attempt to build something with Angular 2.


I'm a big fan of sound synthesis and so I thought it would be a nice idea to start learning Angular 2, Typescript and WebAudio API with a little app 

that provides some synthesis samples.

***
The project was created with Visual Studio 2015 and you can see it by its structure.

***
To run the app you need to run these commands:

`npm install`

`npm start`

inside the music_instr.ui folder.
